{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"Howdy, 👋 I'm Ryan, a software engineer focusing on frontend web and mobile. I hail from the lands of Australia. Self-taught and hands-on, I build apps to achieve ambitions for clients. A keen eye for detail, I collaborate with designers and developers to find a holistic balance between vision and implementation.\n\nLet's pick a technology 😃:\n* **Want an app for the web?** Let's use React, Vue.js or Angular to build our platform. We can add TypeScript for more stability.\n* **More stability?** Let's make sure we write some tests with Cypress and Jest.\n* **How about designs?** We can use a component library or collaborate with Figma or Adobe Suite.\n* **What about mobile?** No problem! We can make a PWA or an app with React Native.\n* **Need a backend?** We can use Node.js or Django with a NoSQL database.\n\nThese are just some of the technologies in my toolkit and always expanding my knowledge to learn more.\n\nGet to know a little more. I wake up with Yoga 🧘, catch-up over a coffee☕️, and relax with some board games 🎲."}},"profile":{"title":"Avatar","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/w1uc8bk21vhe/515244szp92ZqTUgDrhGaW/f2859873022c1eb4e4d92ceda92c3ae9/happy_coffee_smiling_avatar.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
